# Simple-MySQL-php-website

Very simple Php MySQL website created for a school project.


A user based weather station app. For users to log in or register and then upload their weather station then add data to their weather station. Once these stations are added their gps coordinates are added to the states table that only the admin can see. 


Admin login

username = admin
password = password

Once logged in the user can then log in to see which state all the stations are in and which ones are active that day. 

These are MySQL running on a mariadb on linux with php and html pages.
